    "# Finding a Thermal State\n",
    "In this tutorial we will give more details on one of the core functions of the software package:\n",
    "on how to drive a given quantum system to the thermal state via a simulated open quantum system evolution.\n",
    "We will see how to set up everything for the function `run_thermalization` and also what it actually does behind\n",
    "the curtains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `run_thermalization` takes in a basic set of configurations (number of qubits, temperature, etc.),\n",
    "the Hamiltonian $H$ that describes the system, an initial state $\\rho_0$ where the evolution starts from and the set of jumps\n",
    "$\\{A^a\\}$ that prescribe that evolution. It will simulate the [open quantum system evolution](theory_oqs_dynamics.md) or Lindbladian evolution\n",
    "with a [weak-measurement based algorithm](theory_weak_measurement.md). You can read more about them in the Theory section if you follow\n",
    "the links. Here, it is enough to just think of it as the following process:\n",
    "- Start from an initial density matrix $\\rho_0$.\n",
    "- Evolve it for a short $\\delta$ amount of time, $\\rho_\\delta = (\\mathds{1} + \\delta \\mathcal{L})\\rho_0 + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta^2) \\simeq e^{\\delta \\mathcal{L}}(\\rho_0)$.\n",
    "- Repeat until $\\rho_t$ gets close enough to the target state $\\sigma_\\beta = e^{-\\beta H} / Z$, i.e. the Gibbs state.\n",
    "Here the magic is still hidden in the generator $\\mathcal{L}$, but the crucial property it has is that the dynamics it generates,\n",
    "given by $e^{t \\mathcal{L}}$, has the Gibbs state as its unique fixed point. Thus if we evolve the system for a long enough time\n",
    "all other contribution will decay and the only state that survives is the Gibbs state.\n",
