Could add extra complexities if the resulting transition function is not smooth. (See more in Theory).\n\na::Float64 and b::Float64: The parameters that specify the type of linear combination.\neta::Float64: in the case of the Metropolis linear combination, η is an additional coefficient that determines \n\nthe accuracy of the time picture approximation.\n\npicture::AbstractPicture: The picture the simulation runs in (BOHR, ENERGY, TIME, TROTTER). The choice of the\n\npicture represents the levels of approximations we need to get form theory down to quantum circuitry.\n\nnum_energy_bits::Int64: Determines the how coarse the energy and time grid is and thus how accurate the approximations\n\nbetween each picture are.\n\nt0::Float64 and w0::Float64: are the time and energy units we are working with in the Riemann summed integrals.\n\nOf course, the smaller the better but also the costlier, and the two are intertwined due to Fourier: ω₀t₀ = 2π / N.\n\nnum_trotter_steps_per_t0::Int64: The number of Trotter steps used for a unit of time t₀.\n\nCurrently possible linear combinations\n\n(a, b) = {(0, 0) - Gaussian; (>0, 0) - Metropolis; (>0, >0) - Glauber}\n\nAvailable pictures:\n\nThe picture field can be set to one of the following options:\n\nBohrPicture(): The highest level picture where the jump operators and thus the Lindbladian are written in a \n\ndecomposition of Bohr frequencies.\n\nEnergyPicture(): A level lower, in which the operators are approximated by energy integrals.\nTimePicture(): Another level lower, in which the energy approximates are written up as \n\nFourier's of the temporal equals.\n\nTrotterPicture(): The lowest level, thus also the only one implementable on a quantum computer, in which all time\n\nevolutions are replaced via their Trotter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"generated/tutorial/#Tutorial:-Finding-a-Thermal-State","page":"Finding a Thermal State","title":"Tutorial: Finding a Thermal State","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"generated/tutorial/","page":"Finding a Thermal State","title":"Finding a Thermal State","text":"In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of finding the steady-state thermal density matrix rho_ss for a system coupled to a thermal bath.
