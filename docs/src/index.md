# QuantumFurnace.jl

Welcome to the documentation for `QuantumFurnace.jl`.

A high-performance Julia package for simulating open quantum systems that prepare quantum Gibbs states. `QuantumFurnace` is a framework in which the user can both learn about the details of quantum Gibbs sampling, and also research the topic further with the efficient implementations provided here. This project serves as a complementary resource to the recent papers [[CKBG23](#references), [CKG23](#references)] that achieved a breakthrough in the theory of quantum Gibbs sampling.
