    "# Open Quantum System Dynamics\n",
    "We will be working with open quantum systems, i.e. where a system we are interested in $S$ is interacting with an\n",
    "environment #E#. In the weak coupling limit, one can make some more or less reasonable assumptions (Born - lets us\n",
    "treat the subsystem separately from the environment; Markov - the interactions in the bath leave no mark, thus there won't\n",
    "be any back-action on the system; Secular - dropping fast oscillating terms to restore positivity) for which we can find the following\n",
    "Lindbladian generator, that fully describes the time evolution of state $\\rho$ in our system $S$:\n",

    "which generates all the possible temporal maps from some time to a later one, $\\rho(t=0) \\mapsto \\rho(t), as$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho(t) = e^{\\mathcal{L}t}(\\rho_0).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\rho = \\mathcal{L}(\\rho).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We can distinguish two parts in the Lindbladian $\\mathcal{L}$, one corresponds to a coherent evolution with respect\n",
    "to the Hermitian operator $H$. This describes the dynamics of the system where there are no dissipation to the\n",
    "environment due to the interactions. While the sum part, describes the dissipation with respect to the jump\n",
    "operators $L_k$ and with jump rates $\\sqrt{\\gamma_k}$ that are connected to the correlation functions in the environment.\n",

    "Such an open quantum system evolution brings the system $S$ from some initial state $\\rho_0$ to a final state $\\rho(t)$\n",
    "by randomly (given by the jump rates) exploring the state space. If the coherent evolution and the jump operators are such\n",
    "that all possible states in the space is reachable, then such an evolution is called, irreducible and has a unique\n",
    "stationary state $\\sigma$ to which the evolution is converging to. In principle if there are no inescapable traps into which our\n",
    "wandering state can fall into then it will eventually reach its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the environment $E$ is in a thermal equilibrium, then we can derive that for a sufficiently well-chosen set of jump\n",
    "operators, the system $S$ itself will be driven to its thermal equilibrium as well. This state we call the Gibbs state\n",
    "and it is defined as\n",

    "\\sigma_\\beta = \\frac{e^{-\\beta H_S}}{Z_S},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with the inverse temperature $\\beta$, system Hamiltonian $H_S$ and the partition function $Z_S = \\mathrm{tr}[e^{-\\beta H_S}]$.\n",
    "But the environment being in a thermal equilibrium is not a necessary condition, just a sufficient one.\n",
    "In a bottom-top approach, we can also construct jump operators and their rates, such that we don't require the environment to be in\n",
    "thermal equilibrium, yet the system $S$ would still evolve towards its Gibbs state $\\sigma_\\beta$. How this is done,\n",
    "we refer to another entry in the Theory section, called [Detailed Balance](theory_detailed_balance.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s assume that the Gibbs state is indeed what the environment is driving the system toward. By this we\n",
    "also assume that the evolution is irreducible, i.e. that all parts of the state space is reachable over the evolution,\n",
    "in which case the Gibbs state is the unique stationary state of the generator:\n",
